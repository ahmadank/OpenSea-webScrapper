# Description:

This web scrapper was a fun project we started on a long plane flight. The goal of this app is to get live feedback of projects some one is invested
in on the ethereum network, specifically the openSea marketPlace

### `Goals`

- Create a website that retrieves useful information about a project
- Support adding and dropping of new projects.
- Display the data in a clean way

### `Problems`

- Website owners often time hate web scrapping, for that we were not able to retrieve info such as quantity of items being sold.

### `Ideas`

- The website currently relies on cookies to keep user info stored, for that we need a backup option. Generating an option for the user to enter his secret id will allow the user to restore his projects
